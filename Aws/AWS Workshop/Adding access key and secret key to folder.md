### In this module we add our secret key and access key to .aws folder.

#### Folder location:
	Location for folder is : `C:/Users/User_Name/.aws`
##### In this open credentials file which doesn't have any extension and in that paste your access key and secret key.

`aws_access_key_id: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`
`aws_secret_access_key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY`

#### What if you don't have any .aws folder at destination?

In this create a .aws folder in you USER_NAME directory. Create a file named credentials without any extension and add your access key and secret key as said above.
