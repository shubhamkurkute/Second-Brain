- We know we can stop, terminate instances
	- Stop – the data on disk (EBS) is kept intact in the next start
	- Terminate – any EBS volumes (root) also set-up to be destroyed is lost
- On start, the following happens:
	- First start: the OS boots & the EC2 User Data script is run
	- Following starts: the OS boots up
	- Then your application starts, caches get warmed up, and that can take time!
- Introducing EC2 Hibernate:
	- The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved
	- The instance boot is much faster! (the OS is not stopped / restarted)
	- Under the hood: the RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume
	- The root EBS volume must be encrypted
- Use cases:
	- Long-running processing
	- Saving the RAM state
	- Services that take time to initialize
