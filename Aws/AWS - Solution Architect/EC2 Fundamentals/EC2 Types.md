### General Purpose

- Used for webservers or code repositories
- Balance between 
	- Compute
	- Memory
	- Networking

### Compute Optimized
- Great for compute - intensive tasks that require high performance processors
	- Batch processing workloads
	- Media Transcoding
	- High performance computing
	- Scientific modeling and machine learning
	- Dedicated gaming servers

### Memory Optimized
- Fast performance to process large data sets in memory
- Use cases:
	- High performance, relational non-relational DB
	- Distributed web scale cache stores
	- In-memory databases optimized for BI.
	- Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

### Storage Optimized
- Great for storage- intensive tasks that require high sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
- Use Case:
	- High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) system.
	- Relational and NoSQL DB
	- Cache for in memory DB (Redis)
	- Data Warehousing Apps
	- Distributed File System
