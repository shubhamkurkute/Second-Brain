The Open Container Initiative is a Linux foundation project which aims at creating industry standards for container formats and runtimes. Its primary goal is to ensure the compatibility and interoperability of container environments through defined technical specification.

### Dockers role in OCI
Docker is one of the founding members of the OCI and i has played a pivotal role in shaping the standards for container formats and runtimes. Docker initially developed the container formats(Docker Engine) and image format(Docker Image) that serve as the basis for the OCI specification.

### OCI Specifications
1. Runtime Specification(runtime-spec):
	1. It defines the specification for executing a container via isolation technology, like a container engine.
	2. The container runtime built by a docker, called container has guided the development of the OCI runtime-spec.
2.  Image Specification(image-spec):
	1.
